AuthMeIpsBridge is a handy plugin that allows you to link your IPS engine forum with the Authme Reloaded Minecraft plugin.
With its help, a player who has newly created an account on the server automatically appears on the forum with the entered passwords and login directly from Minecraft!

If you want simple and convenient authorization on the forum through Minecraft, this plugin is for you!
